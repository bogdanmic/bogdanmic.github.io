My GithubPages. Maybe I play around a bit with it, maybe not.

Built using **Jekyll** which seems quite nice so far.

For Linux:
```bash
# To start the local env
$ jekyll serve
# To build the website for production
$ JEKYLL_ENV=production jekyll build
```

For Windows:
```bash
# To start the local env
> jekyll serve
# To build the website for production
> $env:JEKYLL_ENV="production"
> jekyll build
```
